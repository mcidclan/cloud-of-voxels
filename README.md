cloud-of-voxels
===============

This is a basic voxels to pixels rendering project,

using ray casting through an octree.

To export your model via blender,

<br/>

just open the blender file and run the python script.

One time is done, replace the voxelmodels.cpp by the generated file.

<br/>

Enjoy!
