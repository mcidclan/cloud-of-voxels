cloud-of-voxels
===============
This is a basic Voxel to Pixel renderer project,

using Ray Tracing through an Octree.

For each Pixel, a Ray is generated and will go through and Octree,

searching for a Voxel. When the Ray hits a Voxel,

the corresponding Pixel is drawn on the screen.

<br/>

To export your model via Blender,

just open the Blender file and run the Python script.

One time is done, replace the voxelmodels.cpp by the generated file.

<br/>

Enjoy!
